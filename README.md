# Overview

This project is a way to (1) try out technologies and (2) reorganize our house.  I hope that by combining these goals, one can provide motivation for the other.  This project aims to help keep track of things in boxes (or other kinds of containers).

Work on it has barely begun.

The plan is to have a JSON service that an iPhone with Siri and Shortcuts can interact with, and a web UI.

# Getting Started

Copy env.template in the root of the project to .env and update it with your DB settings and desired admin password.  Run it with mvnw spring-boot:run.
